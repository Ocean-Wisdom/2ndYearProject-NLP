## Project description
In this project we train different models and each one is trained and run on multiple sets of data, with the difference between each data set being the preprocessing done on the original data.
The goal of this project is to examine how different combinations of preprocessing methods affect the sentiment
analysis accuracy through a simple RNN model and how it compares to a Hugging Face transformers model without heavy preprocessing.

## How to run
In order to reproduce our results you must run the "Simple pipeline", "Bert Uncased" notebooks in order to create, train and test the respective models, and save the files containing the test results.

Afterwards you need to run the "Result Viz" notebook in order to view the result figures.
