Marty Kristian of this group seems to be active in the sense of releasing as late as 2011 albums of demo recordings from the `1970\\'s, available on the New Seekers web site. But for specific fans of Marty, this album features him as lead on 9 tracks, including the previously unreleased New Seekers Come Softly To Me, as well as the very impressive A Woman Grows, (which I\\'m surprised has not been picked up and recorded by others more recently in covers having a great deal of potential) written and sung as well as the more rocking A Midnight Woman.

The music, dance instrumentals and vocals, is bright and diverse in arrangements and moods. A blend of Celtic lilts and old Moorish elements, it reminds me of the music of Renaissance France\\'s Provence. Here are ballads and rich, cheerful dances, such as a funny polka. The harmonies are thick and the beats are strong, producing alternating visions of courtly and festive village dances. The last track of the 42-minute long album excerpts a 1904 archived recording as introduction to a modern take of the song. In short, this album is filled with musical smiles.

But to merely label the Mommyheads as prog-pop does them a disservice, as there\\'s lots to explore here.  This is a rare album that has both instant accessibility and rewards for repeat-listeners, something for long-time fans and for those out there who might be saying \\\\\"The Mommy-whos?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"On A Clear Night\\\\\" kicks things off with a sparse, beautiful piano melody reminiscent of early Tony Banks.  Adam Elk\\'s vocals come in like a lullaby, and we think we know where this is going to take us, but then the drums and guitars kick in and we\\'re happily off in Mommyheads land, where music can be both poppy and experimental, daring and familiar.  This track links nicely with the following track, \\\\\"Gimme Silence\\\\\", continuing with a new piano theme, leading to a percussion and bass pattern that reminded me of Radiohead\\'s \\\\\"The Raindrops\\\\\" but with warmth and funk.  This takes us to the 6/4 beat \\\\\"Science and Reason\\\\\", showing that pop, rock and prog can peacefully coexist in the same track.  Next up is the epic, wonderful \\\\\"Medicine Show\\\\\", probably the album\\'s defining track, a fact that the Mommyheads have underscored by using part of the lyrics for the album\\'s title.  A lovely acoustic guitar and vocal melody gives way to thumping fuzz bass and layers of keyboards and vocals bordering on chaotic, but somehow the Mommyheads effortlessly steer us through it all and we\\'re happy to be along on the journey.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"My Intruder\\\\\" and \\\\\"Skinny White Uptight\\\\\" highlight the more abrasive side of the band, the former track with dark cynicism and the latter with self-effacing humor.  \\\\\"Devastate Me\\\\\" takes a sparse keyboard riff and puts some real bounce into it, \\\\\"Right Where They Should Be\\\\\" and \\\\\"Out on the Cliffs\\\\\" are classic Mommyheads.  \\\\\"Force of Will\\\\\" features a fun little keyboard trill that should sound dated but doesn\\'t.  \\\\\"Silent Age\\\\\" has a man-on-the-corner skiffle feel to it, and \\\\\"Bleed From a Glass\\\\\" ends on a subdued note, returning to the piano themes of the early tracks.  Bonus track \\\\\"No One Gives a Damn About Your Band\\\\\" comes off as fun rather than bitter, although god knows the Mommyheads have a right to be.  As a fan I will say it\\'s a shame that a Mommyheads masterpiece such as \\\\\"Hello Friends\\\\\" has a handful of views on YouTube while Train\\'s \\\\\"Soul Sister\\\\\" rakes in millions.  Both are good songs but the Mommyheads deserve their recognition too!\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I found \\\\\"Vulnerable Boy\\\\\" to be an ambitious, highly listenable mix.  In one sense, the first four tracks make up a complete \\\\\"suite\\\\\", and we\\'re left breathless and wanting more.  And while the rest of the tracks are fine (and at times, great), they lack some of the sonic majesty of those first four tracks.  I get the sense that they were really trying to stretch themselves in the front end of the album.  In particular \\\\\"Skinny White Uptight\\\\\" sticks out as not really belonging here, but damned if the track isn\\'t catchy.  And that\\'s one of the reasons I love the Mommyheads.  As soon as you try to define them or pigeonhole them, they say \\\\\"Wait, but what if we did this?\\\\\"  You end up getting the best of both worlds: invention and accessibility, in one great-sounding package.

If you\\'re looking for a mostly heavy, upbeat, hard rockin\\' CD but enjoy a touch of softer songs, this CD is for you.\\\\n\\\\nContent-wise, their music is geared towards youth and young adults, however I (47) could also relate to many of their topics & themes.

It has a romantic and worthy history, being very much sui generis in content and theme, despite its partial indebtedness to Wagner, having had to be resurrected by the devotion of the composer\\'s friend, who reconstructed the score of Acts 1 and III from memory once they had been lost in a fire.\\\\n\\\\nMy problem is primarily with the lack of variety and the determined portentousness of the music itself. It is beautifully scored but so monochrome in mood that after the first fifteen minutes I found myself desperate for musical relief, which finally arrived in the shape of Jean-Luc Viala\\'s aria for the poet in paradise. For the most part, I can detect little in the way of shape or melody; the music meanders along aimlessly, shepherded by a succession of impressionistic gestures but remaining essentially moribund. It makes for a very long three hours. Of course, my reaction is very subjective and others seem to hear something I cannot, but nor can I say that the fairly simplistic human story, sandwiched between two Acts stuffed with allegorical characters representing various virtues and traits such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Suffering, really enthrals me; I prefer my moral attributes to be operatically enshrined in the depiction of real characters. Some might fairly condemn the libretto as more pretentious than anything Hofmannsthal and Strauss ever penned; certainly I\\'d prefer the dynamism and moral resonance of FROSCH any day.\\\\n\\\\nThe Wagnerian introduction is grand and slow-moving but hardly of a character to justify the conferring upon Magnard by some the title of \\\\\"the French Bruckner\\\\\"; his music is far more static and devoid of momentum. True, it shares a devotional ambience and a preponderance of massive blocks of polychromatic sound with minor key cadences and this quality is intensified by the resonant acoustic of the Toulouse recording venue: the Halle des Grains.\\\\n\\\\nMy other reservations centre upon the singing rather than the music itself. Not that Jos van Dam is anything other than vocally superb and commanding and my admiration extends to several other singers, including the intense, vibrant Hildegard Behrens and the rich, steady Nathalie Stutzmann. However, the other French lady singers in the cast, including those who impersonate the abstract beings and Nadine Denize are generally rather shrill and blowsy, while Gary Lakes\\' tenor is harsh and edgy. The choir, the Orfen Donostiarra, is decidedly inconsistent, with some squally sopranos and several instances of poor intonation throughout.\\\\n\\\\nAs French fin de sicle operas go, this one went; I would far prefer to champion the revival of Chausson\\'s \\\\\"Le roi Arthus\\\\\" than this lumbering and oh-so earnest work. I readily concede that others think differently but for all that I always wanted to like this opera, it left me bored.\", \"summary\": \"Interminable\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1349481600\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"344\"}\\n',\n",

Rahman is known as the Slumdog Millionaire composer. Danny Boyle used him once again for 127 Hours and he was able to prove that he is not just an \\\\\"Indian\\\\\" composer. People Like Us is indeed an interesting choice for the composer and he does indeed demonstrate a more mature and subtle side. People Like Us is writer Alex Kurtzman\\'s directorial debut, and he noted that music was a very important part of the film. Based off the score you can tell how integral the score is. The music is a very distinct narrative as the score flows in dramatic fashion with subtle character nuances and emotional beats.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s really tough to make a modern un-stylized drama score without being one-note and boring. This is a character drama that is solely about the characters and their lives. There is no crazy situations or aliens or anything for the music to absorb. The score absorbes the characters and Rahman is able to mold a very nice story of it. The score works as a whole piece and must be experiences as a full listen from beginning to end. There really aren\\'t any standout tracks that define the score. He introduces his central motif in the first track and that serves as the structure for the whole score\\'s soundscape. The piano and guitar are the most notably featured instruments and as naturally solo instruments they add a distinct human touch to the music. As we come to the end we wrap up the subtle journey in a heartwarming fashion. Everything works out at the end of this story and while some people may find that cliche and cheesy, it does leave you with a nice feeling inside.\\\\n\\\\nThe score is thoroughly enjoyable and does a lot by doing very little. The tone stays pretty much the same the whole way through, and that may be my only gripe. It rarely shifts into heavy emotional territory and because of that it\\'s hard to pick up the conflict of the story within the music. A.R. Rahman handles the whole thing very well and executes it with a uniformed touch. It may be too one-note at times, but the strength of the story in the music makes the characters very identifiable and it becomes a human story we can all feel. An above average modern drama score that shows A.R. Rahman\\'s more universal side.\", \"summary\": \"An Above Average Modern Drama Score That Shows Rahman\\'s More Universal Side\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1342483200\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"371\"}\\n',\n",

Although much of the music has a rather dark quality, it feels more like the darkness of infinite space or of nighttime than anything frightening or sad. It is interesting to note that Suzuki approaches his recordings in much the same way he approaches his paintings - one at a time, finishing one before moving on to the next, allowing the previous pieces to influence the ones that come next. Because of that, the album feels linear and plays as a continuous musical experience. Each of the eight tracks has been given an Episode number, leaving it up to the listener to discern what the music is \\\\\"about\\\\\" - if it is about anything specific at all. Suzuki uses a variety of keyboards and synthesizers to create this music, some of which are newer and some that are vintage. All of the Episodes have melodic passages as well as subtle rhythms and dynamics, and this music works equally well as a backdrop for quiet activities, music for relaxation, and music to get lost in. The sound quality is superb.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the continuity of the album causes it to play as one continuous piece, describing each track isn\\'t too useful.

To me, there seemed to be no forward momentum, general lack of development.  The title of this disc, \\\\\"Caught in Time\\\\\", is therefore apt.  So is the landscape cover-photo of an iceberg.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, then there is an exception.  Soundings II, as the composer says, is a study-work for the flute, providing a wide range of techniques to be practiced.  OK, that sounds like it would be a go-nowhere collection of study pieces.  But this piece seems to actually work.  To me, it appears to be a landscape study that unfolds the various moods and qualities that make a place unique and fulfilling to be in.  No, not much development, but interesting scene building.\\\\n\\\\nFour To Go, ok, that set of 4 pieces seemed to stagnate as well and have no cohesion.  These also seemed to be study pieces for an instrument, in this case a clarinet, but they did not build or develop.  This was more like naked displays of one technique after another, with little concern for momentum, cohesion, or the piece as a whole.  The third movement of the piece, Caught In Time (that\\'s the tempo instructions) is the namesake of the entire album.  And it does seem to be stuck in time, not in a good way.  The fourth and last movement, Relentlessly Yet Always Rockin\\' (again, the tempo instructions), was jazzy but so monotonous.

I prefer it to even that of Glenn Gould. So, this is not only a five-star performance, but amongst the very finest that exist, and the best that I know of. The merits of the performance are already well-known, so there does not seem any real purpose in giving such a fabulous and well-known performance a star rating. Rather, the purpose of this particular release is its transfer to SACD, apparently directly from the master tapes ... which brings one to the sonics.\\\\n\\\\nThese recordings were made in analogue in 1970 -1973 on a Bosendorfer at Schlo&szlig; Klesheim in Salzburg ... tuned about a half-semitone higher than normal pitch. They have always had an unusual resonant sonic ... I have seen others who have complained about it ... but I have always found the sound quite ethereal, and rather well-suited to Herr Bach. So what does SACD do for it?\\\\n\\\\nThe answer is .... odd things. The sound on my original redbook CD release is more raw, more natural, and oddly closer to a natural piano sound than the SACD release. The SACD version sound is sometimes clear, and sometimes muted, and it has unusual piano harmonics. Sometimes, the voicing of parts seems peculiar, or that something is missing. Or sometimes it seems that one part (usually in the mid-range) has unusual clarity, but the other parts are out of balance. The bass line is often emaciated. I couldn\\'t understand this. Then, I listened with headphones ... and I noticed that whereas the original CD version is VERY hissy (unpleasantly so with headphones, but perfectly fine listening with speakers), the SACD version with headphones has almost no hiss whatsoever. And that, I suspect, is the clue to the problem. This is not just a raw transfer from the original analogue tapes to DSD ... Rather, it has been de-greased, wiped with disinfectant, anti-mould and decongestant. To my ears, it sounds rather like the dubious EMI re-releases onto SACD: something that has been so severely over-processed, nuked and radiated ... that the sound has become \\'weird\\'.\\\\n\\\\nFor standard stereo loudspeaker listening, I much prefer my original redbook CD version: the CD version is vastly more natural and more balanced. For headphone listening, I do find the hiss of the original CD a problem, but I am not sure I would want the weird sonics of the SACD version either. Overall then, the SACD version is sadly disappointing. If you do not already have this set, I would go for the standard CD version: far less expensive, and far superior.\\\\n\\\\nPresentation: 4 green Martian discs nicely presented in a standard 4-box CD case.

Quick Lesson: An arrangement is the adaptation of a previously written musical composition for presentation. It may differ from the original form by reharmonization, paraphrasing or development of the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure. (Thanks Wikipedia) So by that definition, that is not what this album is because it does none of those things; and yet it says \\'Arrange Album\\' on the cover.\\\\n\\\\nSo what is this CD then? It is merely an upgrading of the original synthesized music, with newer synthesized music. The result: the same arrangements as the original, with better quality. In fact, when I first listened to it, I couldn\\'t tell a difference. That is until I compared it to the original soundtrack, then I could hear the far better quality and better synth.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s why I\\'m on the fence: there are only 16 tracks on this CD. When you arrange a soundtrack this is understandable. You take a selection of tracks and arrange them, bringing new life to the songs. So in doing this, its reasonable to do a handful of songs from the original soundtrack. However, if your merely upgrading the sound, then why not upgrade all 44 tracks from the original soundtrack? Then that would make this a worthy purchase. After all, Secret of Mana had some beautiful melodies and really deserved one or the other. But this album is neither a true arranged album, nor a fully improved soundtrack. It\\'s more of a sampling on what Secret of Mana could have sounded like if it was better synthesized.\\\\n\\\\nSong List:\\\\n\\\\n1. Genesis ~ Fear of the Heavens - 1:41\\\\n\\\\n2.

This is HEAVY friggin\\' death metal -had I not read up on the band, I\\'d have thought this was a male vocalist...\\\\n\\\\nThe music is hyper fast, hyper heavy and even quite technical.

I would watch this guy to see if he guests on other bands albums.  Very talented.\\\\n\\\\nI still can\\'t get over the fact that this is a female vocalist. I mean, there are a lot more girls (women) in extreme metal now than ever.  I mean Jo Bench is the longest running, having been Bolt Thrower\\'s bassist for about 25 years or so. This lady, Mallika Sundaramurthy, is just beyond finding anything wrong with her performance.  If you do, you\\'re looking WAY too freaking hard, really. She is perfect for this. I bet had I not mentioned it, no one who didn\\'t already know would\\'ve known.

We are hooked in once again by Vanessa\\'s healing sensual voice drifting effortlessly between french and english with those to die for melodies and that layered, rich and dreamy production we have come to expect. It\\'s all here,  losing nothing of the song craft or dextrous musicianship of the debut album, not at all, it\\'s all there just as i hoped and dreamed it would be... even without the talent of a certain James Iha this time round.. although Mr Iha has doffed his cap to the O\\'s by releasing his own version of The O\\'s track \\'Till Next Tuesday\\' on his new album \\'Look To The Sky\\', another fine album to savour if you haven\\'t already.\\\\n\\\\nLa Ballade d\\'O was my unexpected album of the century, Stories For Watering Skies had a big responsibility on it\\'s shoulders to follow it, I didn\\'t think it could possibly be improved upon but I can say now as I discover this album more and more the impossible is achieved.\\\\n\\\\n<a data-hook=\\\\\"product-link-linked\\\\\" class=\\\\\"a-link-normal\\\\\" href=\\\\\"/La-Ballade-d-O/dp/B000FBIYMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\\\\\">La Ballade d\\'O</a>\", \"summary\": \"Wow! swedish French alt popsters Vanessa & the O\\'s release fabulous new album!\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1350864000\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\", \"id\": \"525\"}\\n',\n",

Prior to this, Pappy distributed Bally jukeboxes until WWII shut down production, then he opened a record shop; Jack was a nightclub operator and talent agent. STARDAY, a combination of their last names, grew out of Pappy\\'s wholesale record distributorship. Their earliest waxings were made in Jack\\'s home studio. George Jones was the first of many consistent hit-makers to join the label.\\\\n\\\\nAfter Don Pierce invested in the company in \\'53, STARDAY relocated to L.A. Around that time, Jack sold his shares to his partners. In \\'57 there was another move to Madison, TN. A year later Pierce bought out Pappy entirely.

Why on earth would Paul McCartney desecrate his most-famed song by singing about scrambled eggs?\\\\n\\\\nIt is because that was how he originally wrote it.  Paul has often remarked about how he will get a good tune in his head and fill in the words with jibberish just to keep the tune going until he can commit it to tape or memory.  As the story goes, McCartney had dreamt the music to \\\\\"Yesterday\\\\\" and woke up coming up with the first thing he could to keep the tune going:  \\\\\"Scrambled Eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs.\\\\\"  The song existed as such for weeks until he was sure he didn\\'t plagiarize the music from someone else.  At that point, the proper lyrics were written and history was made.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost fifty years later, the idea was revisited with Paul\\'s appearance on Jimmy Fallon\\'s show and additional lyrics were written under the original vein.  Paul even managed to work in a somewhat awkward vegitarian plug with the almost sung verse on chicken wings.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s fun, strange, and unique.  It isn\\'t too rediculous and they make sure to keep the spontaneous sound of the rewrite during the performance without trying too hard.\\\\n\\\\nI left a star off because for as much of a McCartney fan that I am, I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as I thought I would for whatever reason.\", \"summary\": \"Goofy but historically significant one-off\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1363910400\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\", \"id\": \"673\"}\\n',\n",

Scottish traditional music and folk melodies have an adaptable quality that renders the best of them timeless. Paraphrases from the Scottish Psalter like Psalm 23 have been sung across the world for centuries, and it\\'s important to remind new generations that these ancient words of scripture remain profoundly relevant. Scottish writers like Horatius Bonar and James Montgomery showed that a wealth of transforming biblical truths could be taught and absorbed through songs, so we also wanted to introduce examples of their lyrics to new listeners.\\\\n\\\\nThe motivation for making this hymns recording did not spring simply from a desire to create art. Hymnwriting is about making music firstly out of gratitude to Jesus Christ. With all our imperfections and limitations, Christians struggle to express anything more than an echo of His greatness, but we believe that this is a thing eminently worth sharing. For the person who finds this idea strange, it will hopefully make more sense as you listen! Our hope is that every listener might hear the joy that comes from the gospel: the good news of God\\'s saving and transforming love, made available to every person through his son, Jesus.\\\\n\\\\nABOUT NEW SCOTTISH ARTS\\\\nNew Scottish Arts is an arts outreach & education ministry. Our purpose is to serve the Christian community in Scotland by enabling Christians to share their faith through the creative arts, by facilitating vibrant outreach events and projects that will impact on local communities and the whole of Scotland.\", \"summary\": \"excellent songs & production\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1358380800\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"683\"}\\n',\n",

So, to you, prospective listener, I ask you this:\\\\n\\\\nBefore you hit play, you need to take a deep breath, and treat this as something exclusive from all other works.  It is not, in any way similar to not only those styles, but the emotions evoked.  It is an entirely different animal-- no, it\\'s an entirely different species; life form, maybe.  This, to some, should come as no surprise.\\\\n\\\\nWhat we have here is something that\\'s not necessarily \\'powerful\\' in the sense that a listener would be used to-- you have to hunt for it, a bit.  If you\\'re an audiophile like I consider myself, this should come as no surprise.  Good music grows on you-- sometimes like a sickness, sometimes like a deep, profound joy.  This album kind of did both.\\\\n\\\\nThere is definitely something altogether eclectic and strange about Scheidt\\'s lyrical presence in this record-- his first two tracks have sparse instrumentals, and mainly focus on him setting the stage for this emotional journey.  He constructs, presents, and confronts-- although a bit abstractly- a lineup of his own demons, and kills them systematically with kindness, joy, love, and pure emotional vulnerability.  It\\'s alien flower-power, but it also displays exactly where one would imagine Scheidt\\'s soul to reside-- and this is what I think separates Scheidt\\'s vision from a good lot of other artists and musicians: Scheidt\\'s biggest weapon (and in Yob, too) is his ability to turn anything into lead.  His airy, shy vocals in this album give way sometimes and the sheer profundity of the narrative is a bit staggering at times.

This is Rokke\\'s third CD to date, following \\\\\"Joy,\\\\\" a Christmas collection, and \\\\\"Tell the Story,\\\\\" a collection of hymns, both released in 2009. A longtime music educator, church musician, and the wife and daughter of Lutheran pastors, Ms Rokke brings a lifetime of musical experience to her recordings. She has played the piano for many, many weddings over the years, and this collection is made up of favorites that she has used as preludes, postludes, processionals, and recessionals. Several of the pieces are very standard wedding faire - Wagner\\'s \\\\\"Bridal Chorus\\\\\" (often referred to as \\\\\"Here Comes the Bride\\\\\"), Mendelssohn\\'s \\\\\"Wedding March,\\\\\" and the venerable Pachelbel\\'s \\\\\"Canon in D,\\\\\" but there is also an assortment of other wedding-appropriate classical music that isn\\'t nearly as commonly heard. Along with being a very warm and pleasant CD to listen to, \\\\\"Wedding Classics\\\\\"  provides brides and wedding planners a one-stop sampler of music to choose from for that special day. The liner notes of the CD also give a brief but informative history of each piece and its composer. The CD contains a bonus track, \\\\\"Prelude In a Classic Style\\\\\" by Gordon Young, a contemporary composer who passed away in 1998. Several of these pieces were originally composed for organ or for orchestra, and Ms Rokke has arranged those for piano solo. The composers represented are Henry Purcell, George F. Handel (2), JS Bach (5), Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy (2), Gordon Young, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Pachelbel, Cesar Franck, Jeremiah Clarke, and Edvard Grieg. My own favorites include Handel\\'s \\\\\"Thanks Be To Thee,\\\\\" Bach\\'s \\\\\"Cello Suite #1,\\\\\" Debussy\\'s \\\\\"Reverie,\\\\\" Young\\'s \\\\\"Prelude In Classic Style,\\\\\" Bach\\'s \\\\\"Arioso,\\\\\" Franck\\'s \\\\\"Panis Angelicus,\\\\\" and Grieg\\'s \\\\\"Wedding Day At Troldhaugen.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis album makes for very pleasant listening and is a handy tool for selecting music for a wedding.\", \"summary\": \"From MainlyPiano\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1340409600\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"746\"}\\n',\n",

It started in the `60s, really, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and then the Americans, Mike Bloomfield, Ry Cooder, Johnny Winter. The 70s gave us Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Santana, Duane Allman, the 80s Mark Knopfler and so on. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many more have come on the scene since. It\\'s an attractive niche to try and fit into. It has so much room to shine. And it is easy to fail; get lost in the crowd. There\\'s the whole \\\\\"cross roads\\\\\" myth about having to sell your soul to really be granted that extra something that it takes to be the next Jimi Hendrix, the next Robert Johnson.\\\\n\\\\nDave Fields is in the new crop and he just may have it. Hi third album,  Detonation, explodes with a harder rocking sound drenched in many a variety of styles touching on classic rock , jazz-blues and reggae mixed in with a blast of blinding blues that pays tribute, most notably to Beck and Hendrix with nods to Buddy Guy (especially in those passages where the notes fly off his ax like shrapnel in the middle of soulful songs).\\\\n\\\\nFrom the first notes of the opening song, \\\\\"Addicted To Your Fire\\\\\" (which you\\'d have to be blind or deaf not to recognize Hendrix \\\\\"Stand Next To You Fire\\\\\" in) it is apparent that he is setting the bar at Jimi height.\\\\n\\\\nFields explores 1960s psychedelia on \\\\\"Prophet in Disguise,\\\\\" a melodic track with an Eastern-influenced guitar lick that is more David Gilmour than George Harrison. Track three is a favorite. \\\\\"Doin Hard Time,\\\\\" is slow, smoldering blues duet with Grammy Award Winning blues singer and guitarist,  Joe Louis Walker that works very well. Track five is a fun song, \\\\\"Bad Hair Day,\\\\\" is an interesting mix of reggae and the blues, vowing not to let his hair get him down.\\\\n\\\\nOn \\\\\"Better Be Good\\\\\" you can hear him channeling SRV to good effect. It delivers some social commentary and his guitar is at the best here as he pulls everything out of his bag of tricks. The purest blues tune on the album is probably \\\\\"Pocket Full Of Dust\\\\\", The guitar attacks and it stings. It\\'s soaked in blues soul ala Buddy Guy and the great Chicago stylists. The organ of Vladimir Barsky works well behind his guitar explosions and drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Andy Huenerberg round out his band quite well.\\\\n\\\\nDetonation is produced by David Z (Prince, Johnny Lang, Etta James, Buddy Guy) and  is a 12-song exploration of Fields\\'  electrifying guitar prowess. This album has the feel of Fields stepping out of the pure blues spot light and expanding his sound into more rock, but he never, like all the greats before him, completely abandons the blues, instead he has absorbed them and is ready to let the blues be his foundation for what he creates from here on out.\\\\n\\\\nThe Dirty Lowdown\", \"summary\": \"Dave Fields is in the new crop of blues guiatrists and he just may have it\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1350259200\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"839\"}\\n',\n",

The music, dance instrumentals and vocals, is bright and diverse in arrangements and moods. A blend of Celtic lilts and old Moorish elements, it reminds me of the music of Renaissance France\\'s Provence. Here are ballads and rich, cheerful dances, such as a funny polka. The harmonies are thick and the beats are strong, producing alternating visions of courtly and festive village dances. The last track of the 42-minute long album excerpts a 1904 archived recording as introduction to a modern take of the song. In short, this album is filled with musical smiles.

But to merely label the Mommyheads as prog-pop does them a disservice, as there\\'s lots to explore here.  This is a rare album that has both instant accessibility and rewards for repeat-listeners, something for long-time fans and for those out there who might be saying \\\\\"The Mommy-whos?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"On A Clear Night\\\\\" kicks things off with a sparse, beautiful piano melody reminiscent of early Tony Banks.  Adam Elk\\'s vocals come in like a lullaby, and we think we know where this is going to take us, but then the drums and guitars kick in and we\\'re happily off in Mommyheads land, where music can be both poppy and experimental, daring and familiar.  This track links nicely with the following track, \\\\\"Gimme Silence\\\\\", continuing with a new piano theme, leading to a percussion and bass pattern that reminded me of Radiohead\\'s \\\\\"The Raindrops\\\\\" but with warmth and funk.  This takes us to the 6/4 beat \\\\\"Science and Reason\\\\\", showing that pop, rock and prog can peacefully coexist in the same track.  Next up is the epic, wonderful \\\\\"Medicine Show\\\\\", probably the album\\'s defining track, a fact that the Mommyheads have underscored by using part of the lyrics for the album\\'s title.  A lovely acoustic guitar and vocal melody gives way to thumping fuzz bass and layers of keyboards and vocals bordering on chaotic, but somehow the Mommyheads effortlessly steer us through it all and we\\'re happy to be along on the journey.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"My Intruder\\\\\" and \\\\\"Skinny White Uptight\\\\\" highlight the more abrasive side of the band, the former track with dark cynicism and the latter with self-effacing humor.  \\\\\"Devastate Me\\\\\" takes a sparse keyboard riff and puts some real bounce into it, \\\\\"Right Where They Should Be\\\\\" and \\\\\"Out on the Cliffs\\\\\" are classic Mommyheads.  \\\\\"Force of Will\\\\\" features a fun little keyboard trill that should sound dated but doesn\\'t.  \\\\\"Silent Age\\\\\" has a man-on-the-corner skiffle feel to it, and \\\\\"Bleed From a Glass\\\\\" ends on a subdued note, returning to the piano themes of the early tracks.  Bonus track \\\\\"No One Gives a Damn About Your Band\\\\\" comes off as fun rather than bitter, although god knows the Mommyheads have a right to be.  As a fan I will say it\\'s a shame that a Mommyheads masterpiece such as \\\\\"Hello Friends\\\\\" has a handful of views on YouTube while Train\\'s \\\\\"Soul Sister\\\\\" rakes in millions.  Both are good songs but the Mommyheads deserve their recognition too!\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I found \\\\\"Vulnerable Boy\\\\\" to be an ambitious, highly listenable mix.  In one sense, the first four tracks make up a complete \\\\\"suite\\\\\", and we\\'re left breathless and wanting more.  And while the rest of the tracks are fine (and at times, great), they lack some of the sonic majesty of those first four tracks.  I get the sense that they were really trying to stretch themselves in the front end of the album.  In particular \\\\\"Skinny White Uptight\\\\\" sticks out as not really belonging here, but damned if the track isn\\'t catchy.  And that\\'s one of the reasons I love the Mommyheads.  As soon as you try to define them or pigeonhole them, they say \\\\\"Wait, but what if we did this?\\\\\"  You end up getting the best of both worlds: invention and accessibility, in one great-sounding package.

I hope the makers aren\\'t offended. This is just my opinion. I think that as a fan effort this is awesome. But there\\'s nothing here that justifies charging for it.

It has a romantic and worthy history, being very much sui generis in content and theme, despite its partial indebtedness to Wagner, having had to be resurrected by the devotion of the composer\\'s friend, who reconstructed the score of Acts 1 and III from memory once they had been lost in a fire.\\\\n\\\\nMy problem is primarily with the lack of variety and the determined portentousness of the music itself. It is beautifully scored but so monochrome in mood that after the first fifteen minutes I found myself desperate for musical relief, which finally arrived in the shape of Jean-Luc Viala\\'s aria for the poet in paradise. For the most part, I can detect little in the way of shape or melody; the music meanders along aimlessly, shepherded by a succession of impressionistic gestures but remaining essentially moribund. It makes for a very long three hours. Of course, my reaction is very subjective and others seem to hear something I cannot, but nor can I say that the fairly simplistic human story, sandwiched between two Acts stuffed with allegorical characters representing various virtues and traits such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Suffering, really enthrals me; I prefer my moral attributes to be operatically enshrined in the depiction of real characters. Some might fairly condemn the libretto as more pretentious than anything Hofmannsthal and Strauss ever penned; certainly I\\'d prefer the dynamism and moral resonance of FROSCH any day.\\\\n\\\\nThe Wagnerian introduction is grand and slow-moving but hardly of a character to justify the conferring upon Magnard by some the title of \\\\\"the French Bruckner\\\\\"; his music is far more static and devoid of momentum. True, it shares a devotional ambience and a preponderance of massive blocks of polychromatic sound with minor key cadences and this quality is intensified by the resonant acoustic of the Toulouse recording venue: the Halle des Grains.\\\\n\\\\nMy other reservations centre upon the singing rather than the music itself. Not that Jos van Dam is anything other than vocally superb and commanding and my admiration extends to several other singers, including the intense, vibrant Hildegard Behrens and the rich, steady Nathalie Stutzmann. However, the other French lady singers in the cast, including those who impersonate the abstract beings and Nadine Denize are generally rather shrill and blowsy, while Gary Lakes\\' tenor is harsh and edgy. The choir, the Orfen Donostiarra, is decidedly inconsistent, with some squally sopranos and several instances of poor intonation throughout.\\\\n\\\\nAs French fin de sicle operas go, this one went; I would far prefer to champion the revival of Chausson\\'s \\\\\"Le roi Arthus\\\\\" than this lumbering and oh-so earnest work.

Rahman is known as the Slumdog Millionaire composer. Danny Boyle used him once again for 127 Hours and he was able to prove that he is not just an \\\\\"Indian\\\\\" composer. People Like Us is indeed an interesting choice for the composer and he does indeed demonstrate a more mature and subtle side. People Like Us is writer Alex Kurtzman\\'s directorial debut, and he noted that music was a very important part of the film. Based off the score you can tell how integral the score is. The music is a very distinct narrative as the score flows in dramatic fashion with subtle character nuances and emotional beats.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s really tough to make a modern un-stylized drama score without being one-note and boring. This is a character drama that is solely about the characters and their lives. There is no crazy situations or aliens or anything for the music to absorb. The score absorbes the characters and Rahman is able to mold a very nice story of it. The score works as a whole piece and must be experiences as a full listen from beginning to end. There really aren\\'t any standout tracks that define the score. He introduces his central motif in the first track and that serves as the structure for the whole score\\'s soundscape. The piano and guitar are the most notably featured instruments and as naturally solo instruments they add a distinct human touch to the music. As we come to the end we wrap up the subtle journey in a heartwarming fashion. Everything works out at the end of this story and while some people may find that cliche and cheesy, it does leave you with a nice feeling inside.\\\\n\\\\nThe score is thoroughly enjoyable and does a lot by doing very little. The tone stays pretty much the same the whole way through, and that may be my only gripe. It rarely shifts into heavy emotional territory and because of that it\\'s hard to pick up the conflict of the story within the music. A.R. Rahman handles the whole thing very well and executes it with a uniformed touch. It may be too one-note at times, but the strength of the story in the music makes the characters very identifiable and it becomes a human story we can all feel.

Rahman\\'s more universal side.\", \"summary\": \"An Above Average Modern Drama Score That Shows Rahman\\'s More Universal Side\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1342483200\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"371\"}\\n',\n",

Although much of the music has a rather dark quality, it feels more like the darkness of infinite space or of nighttime than anything frightening or sad. It is interesting to note that Suzuki approaches his recordings in much the same way he approaches his paintings - one at a time, finishing one before moving on to the next, allowing the previous pieces to influence the ones that come next. Because of that, the album feels linear and plays as a continuous musical experience. Each of the eight tracks has been given an Episode number, leaving it up to the listener to discern what the music is \\\\\"about\\\\\" - if it is about anything specific at all. Suzuki uses a variety of keyboards and synthesizers to create this music, some of which are newer and some that are vintage. All of the Episodes have melodic passages as well as subtle rhythms and dynamics, and this music works equally well as a backdrop for quiet activities, music for relaxation, and music to get lost in. The sound quality is superb.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the continuity of the album causes it to play as one continuous piece, describing each track isn\\'t too useful.

I prefer it to even that of Glenn Gould. So, this is not only a five-star performance, but amongst the very finest that exist, and the best that I know of. The merits of the performance are already well-known, so there does not seem any real purpose in giving such a fabulous and well-known performance a star rating. Rather, the purpose of this particular release is its transfer to SACD, apparently directly from the master tapes ... which brings one to the sonics.\\\\n\\\\nThese recordings were made in analogue in 1970 -1973 on a Bosendorfer at Schlo&szlig; Klesheim in Salzburg ... tuned about a half-semitone higher than normal pitch. They have always had an unusual resonant sonic ... I have seen others who have complained about it ... but I have always found the sound quite ethereal, and rather well-suited to Herr Bach. So what does SACD do for it?\\\\n\\\\nThe answer is .... odd things. The sound on my original redbook CD release is more raw, more natural, and oddly closer to a natural piano sound than the SACD release. The SACD version sound is sometimes clear, and sometimes muted, and it has unusual piano harmonics. Sometimes, the voicing of parts seems peculiar, or that something is missing. Or sometimes it seems that one part (usually in the mid-range) has unusual clarity, but the other parts are out of balance. The bass line is often emaciated. I couldn\\'t understand this. Then, I listened with headphones ... and I noticed that whereas the original CD version is VERY hissy (unpleasantly so with headphones, but perfectly fine listening with speakers), the SACD version with headphones has almost no hiss whatsoever. And that, I suspect, is the clue to the problem. This is not just a raw transfer from the original analogue tapes to DSD ... Rather, it has been de-greased, wiped with disinfectant, anti-mould and decongestant. To my ears, it sounds rather like the dubious EMI re-releases onto SACD: something that has been so severely over-processed, nuked and radiated ... that the sound has become \\'weird\\'.\\\\n\\\\nFor standard stereo loudspeaker listening, I much prefer my original redbook CD version: the CD version is vastly more natural and more balanced. For headphone listening, I do find the hiss of the original CD a problem, but I am not sure I would want the weird sonics of the SACD version either. Overall then, the SACD version is sadly disappointing. If you do not already have this set, I would go for the standard CD version: far less expensive, and far superior.\\\\n\\\\nPresentation: 4 green Martian discs nicely presented in a standard 4-box CD case.

Quick Lesson: An arrangement is the adaptation of a previously written musical composition for presentation. It may differ from the original form by reharmonization, paraphrasing or development of the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure. (Thanks Wikipedia) So by that definition, that is not what this album is because it does none of those things; and yet it says \\'Arrange Album\\' on the cover.\\\\n\\\\nSo what is this CD then? It is merely an upgrading of the original synthesized music, with newer synthesized music. The result: the same arrangements as the original, with better quality. In fact, when I first listened to it, I couldn\\'t tell a difference. That is until I compared it to the original soundtrack, then I could hear the far better quality and better synth.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s why I\\'m on the fence: there are only 16 tracks on this CD. When you arrange a soundtrack this is understandable. You take a selection of tracks and arrange them, bringing new life to the songs. So in doing this, its reasonable to do a handful of songs from the original soundtrack. However, if your merely upgrading the sound, then why not upgrade all 44 tracks from the original soundtrack? Then that would make this a worthy purchase. After all, Secret of Mana had some beautiful melodies and really deserved one or the other.

Scottish traditional music and folk melodies have an adaptable quality that renders the best of them timeless. Paraphrases from the Scottish Psalter like Psalm 23 have been sung across the world for centuries, and it\\'s important to remind new generations that these ancient words of scripture remain profoundly relevant. Scottish writers like Horatius Bonar and James Montgomery showed that a wealth of transforming biblical truths could be taught and absorbed through songs, so we also wanted to introduce examples of their lyrics to new listeners.\\\\n\\\\nThe motivation for making this hymns recording did not spring simply from a desire to create art. Hymnwriting is about making music firstly out of gratitude to Jesus Christ. With all our imperfections and limitations, Christians struggle to express anything more than an echo of His greatness, but we believe that this is a thing eminently worth sharing. For the person who finds this idea strange, it will hopefully make more sense as you listen! Our hope is that every listener might hear the joy that comes from the gospel: the good news of God\\'s saving and transforming love, made available to every person through his son, Jesus.\\\\n\\\\nABOUT NEW SCOTTISH ARTS\\\\nNew Scottish Arts is an arts outreach & education ministry. Our purpose is to serve the Christian community in Scotland by enabling Christians to share their faith through the creative arts, by facilitating vibrant outreach events and projects that will impact on local communities and the whole of Scotland.\", \"summary\": \"excellent songs & production\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1358380800\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"683\"}\\n',\n",

So, to you, prospective listener, I ask you this:\\\\n\\\\nBefore you hit play, you need to take a deep breath, and treat this as something exclusive from all other works.  It is not, in any way similar to not only those styles, but the emotions evoked.  It is an entirely different animal-- no, it\\'s an entirely different species; life form, maybe.  This, to some, should come as no surprise.\\\\n\\\\nWhat we have here is something that\\'s not necessarily \\'powerful\\' in the sense that a listener would be used to-- you have to hunt for it, a bit.  If you\\'re an audiophile like I consider myself, this should come as no surprise.  Good music grows on you-- sometimes like a sickness, sometimes like a deep, profound joy.  This album kind of did both.\\\\n\\\\nThere is definitely something altogether eclectic and strange about Scheidt\\'s lyrical presence in this record-- his first two tracks have sparse instrumentals, and mainly focus on him setting the stage for this emotional journey.  He constructs, presents, and confronts-- although a bit abstractly- a lineup of his own demons, and kills them systematically with kindness, joy, love, and pure emotional vulnerability.  It\\'s alien flower-power, but it also displays exactly where one would imagine Scheidt\\'s soul to reside-- and this is what I think separates Scheidt\\'s vision from a good lot of other artists and musicians: Scheidt\\'s biggest weapon (and in Yob, too) is his ability to turn anything into lead.  His airy, shy vocals in this album give way sometimes and the sheer profundity of the narrative is a bit staggering at times.  Some won\\'t like this style from Scheidt, some will be indifferent, and others will accept it with, just as he presents it, open arms.\\\\n\\\\nI find myself having a difficult time quantifying this album-- I don\\'t think it should be critiqued the way that other albums so helplessly rise and fall.  It\\'s designed to be intimate-- to be personal, so while I have an idea of how I would, hypothetically, quantify it, I\\'m going to leave it at a 4 star rating, not because it\\'s good or great or, but because it asks to be heard in such a way that I think anything less wouldn\\'t be doing Scheidt any justice.\", \"summary\": \"Doom metal Juggernaut shows awkward, softer side\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1350432000\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\", \"id\": \"739\"}\\n',\n",

A longtime music educator, church musician, and the wife and daughter of Lutheran pastors, Ms Rokke brings a lifetime of musical experience to her recordings. She has played the piano for many, many weddings over the years, and this collection is made up of favorites that she has used as preludes, postludes, processionals, and recessionals. Several of the pieces are very standard wedding faire - Wagner\\'s \\\\\"Bridal Chorus\\\\\" (often referred to as \\\\\"Here Comes the Bride\\\\\"), Mendelssohn\\'s \\\\\"Wedding March,\\\\\" and the venerable Pachelbel\\'s \\\\\"Canon in D,\\\\\" but there is also an assortment of other wedding-appropriate classical music that isn\\'t nearly as commonly heard. Along with being a very warm and pleasant CD to listen to, \\\\\"Wedding Classics\\\\\"  provides brides and wedding planners a one-stop sampler of music to choose from for that special day. The liner notes of the CD also give a brief but informative history of each piece and its composer. The CD contains a bonus track, \\\\\"Prelude In a Classic Style\\\\\" by Gordon Young, a contemporary composer who passed away in 1998. Several of these pieces were originally composed for organ or for orchestra, and Ms Rokke has arranged those for piano solo. The composers represented are Henry Purcell, George F. Handel (2), JS Bach (5), Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy (2), Gordon Young, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Pachelbel, Cesar Franck, Jeremiah Clarke, and Edvard Grieg.

It started in the `60s, really, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and then the Americans, Mike Bloomfield, Ry Cooder, Johnny Winter. The 70s gave us Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Santana, Duane Allman, the 80s Mark Knopfler and so on. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many more have come on the scene since. It\\'s an attractive niche to try and fit into. It has so much room to shine. And it is easy to fail; get lost in the crowd. There\\'s the whole \\\\\"cross roads\\\\\" myth about having to sell your soul to really be granted that extra something that it takes to be the next Jimi Hendrix, the next Robert Johnson.\\\\n\\\\nDave Fields is in the new crop and he just may have it. Hi third album,  Detonation, explodes with a harder rocking sound drenched in many a variety of styles touching on classic rock , jazz-blues and reggae mixed in with a blast of blinding blues that pays tribute, most notably to Beck and Hendrix with nods to Buddy Guy (especially in those passages where the notes fly off his ax like shrapnel in the middle of soulful songs).\\\\n\\\\nFrom the first notes of the opening song, \\\\\"Addicted To Your Fire\\\\\" (which you\\'d have to be blind or deaf not to recognize Hendrix \\\\\"Stand Next To You Fire\\\\\" in) it is apparent that he is setting the bar at Jimi height.\\\\n\\\\nFields explores 1960s psychedelia on \\\\\"Prophet in Disguise,\\\\\" a melodic track with an Eastern-influenced guitar lick that is more David Gilmour than George Harrison. Track three is a favorite. \\\\\"Doin Hard Time,\\\\\" is slow, smoldering blues duet with Grammy Award Winning blues singer and guitarist,  Joe Louis Walker that works very well. Track five is a fun song, \\\\\"Bad Hair Day,\\\\\" is an interesting mix of reggae and the blues, vowing not to let his hair get him down.\\\\n\\\\nOn \\\\\"Better Be Good\\\\\" you can hear him channeling SRV to good effect. It delivers some social commentary and his guitar is at the best here as he pulls everything out of his bag of tricks. The purest blues tune on the album is probably \\\\\"Pocket Full Of Dust\\\\\", The guitar attacks and it stings. It\\'s soaked in blues soul ala Buddy Guy and the great Chicago stylists. The organ of Vladimir Barsky works well behind his guitar explosions and drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Andy Huenerberg round out his band quite well.\\\\n\\\\nDetonation is produced by David Z (Prince, Johnny Lang, Etta James, Buddy Guy) and  is a 12-song exploration of Fields\\'  electrifying guitar prowess. This album has the feel of Fields stepping out of the pure blues spot light and expanding his sound into more rock, but he never, like all the greats before him, completely abandons the blues, instead he has absorbed them and is ready to let the blues be his foundation for what he creates from here on out.\\\\n\\\\nThe Dirty Lowdown\", \"summary\": \"Dave Fields is in the new crop of blues guiatrists and he just may have it\", \"unixReviewTime\": \"1350259200\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"id\": \"839\"}\\n',\n",
